    <p>
        Zilla  Bot  Gamma  is  the  third  version  of  Zilla  Bot  and  is  the  latest  and  most  extensive  update  of  all  time.  The  previous  version,  Zilla  Bot  Beta,  had  custom  commands,  built-in  commands,  responses  to  various  emotes  and  texts,  but  was  more  or  less  a  "fun  bot"  to  simply  mess  around  with.  All  that  changed  with  the  introduction  of  Zilla  Bot  Gamma.  This  bot  retains  the  custom  commands,  while  adding  a  whopping  ton  of  new  features  including  custom  reactions,  moderator  and  logging  functionality,  Clash  of  Clans  API  support,  Discord  Music  bot  functionality,  as  well  as  a  personalized  website  for  it,  which  you  are  reading  right  now.
